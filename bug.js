This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The error message is usually vague, often mentioning something about the Android build process failing but without specific details.  The problem may stem from a mismatch between the Expo SDK version, the Gradle version, or other dependencies within your project's `android` folder. This makes diagnosing the root cause difficult.
