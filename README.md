# Vague Android Build Error in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates a common but frustrating issue when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The error messages are often unhelpful, providing little insight into the underlying problem.  This example showcases a scenario where dependency version mismatches can lead to such errors, and how to potentially resolve them.

## Problem
The Expo CLI Android build fails with an ambiguous error message, such as "Build failed" or similar vague descriptions. There is often no clear indication of the specific issue.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing your project's dependencies and ensuring compatibility between Expo SDK version, Gradle version, and other libraries.  Cleaning the project's build cache and re-running the build can also be helpful.  In certain situations, updating the dependencies to their latest stable versions might be the key.  If the issue persists, consulting Expo's documentation or seeking help on their community forum is recommended.
