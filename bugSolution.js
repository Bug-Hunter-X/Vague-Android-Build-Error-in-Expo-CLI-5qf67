The exact solution depends on the root cause, which may vary. The following code snippet doesn't directly fix the error, but it showcases potential areas to examine and improve:

```javascript
// In your app's package.json
// Ensure that your expo and related dependencies are up-to-date
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^48.0.18", // or latest version
    // ...other dependencies
  }
}

// In your android/app/build.gradle
// Check your Gradle version and other configurations
android {
    compileSdkVersion 33
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "your.app.id"
        minSdkVersion 21 //Check if this is appropriate
        targetSdkVersion 33
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    // ... other Android build settings
}

// Clean the project
// expo prebuild -c
expo run:android
```
